# Visualizing Political Leaders
This interactive visualization is consisted of three views, 1) a lexis chart showing the age, start year and end year of their appointment; 2) A scatter plot showing teh age and GDP per capital of a contry; 3) the histogram of the count of leaders by gender. 
The three viewed are connected: a click on the arrow on the Lexis chart will highlight itself as well as the corresponding leader in the scatter plot; and a click on the scatter plot would have the same kind of effect. The histogram serves as a global filter, a click on which will allow users to examine the leaders by gender.
